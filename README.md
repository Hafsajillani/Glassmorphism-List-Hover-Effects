Here's a brief explanation of each of these CSS properties which is used in this project.



1. line-height: This property sets the height of a line of text. It can be a specific length, a percentage of the font size, or a unitless number. Increasing line-height can improve readability and spacing within blocks of text.



2. transition: This property allows you to smoothly change the value of a CSS property over a specified duration. It is often used to create animations or transitions, such as changing the color of a button when it is hovered over.



3. z-index: This property controls the stack order of elements. Elements with a higher z-index are displayed in front of elements with a lower z-index. It is particularly useful when working with overlapping elements or layers.



4. object-fit: This property specifies how an <img>, <video>, or <object> should be resized to fit its container. It can be set to fill, contain, cover, none, or scale-down, each affecting how the media is displayed within its container.



5. font-weight: This property sets the thickness of the font. It can be set to normal, bold, bolder, lighter, or a specific numerical value (100 to 900 in increments of 100).



6. opacity: This property sets the transparency of an element. A value of 1 is fully opaque, while a value of 0 is fully transparent. Values between 0 and 1 create varying levels of transparency.



7. em: This unit is relative to the font size of the parent element. For example, if a parent element has a font size of 16px, 1em is equal to 16px. Using em for font sizes can help maintain scalability and accessibility.



8. rem: Similar to em, but relative to the root element (html). This makes rem useful for creating consistent spacing and sizing across an entire document, unaffected by nested elements' font sizes.
